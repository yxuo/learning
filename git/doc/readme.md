## Naming folders and files

So far this moment I haven't found anything about an official naming convention from either Git or GitHub.

Therefore, I'm based on my experience, opinions and recommendations of the community.

### Restrictions

Any system have boundaries, this will be the topic here.

* Some systems are case sensitive `Folder` and `folder` cohexist), some systems aren't.

  If your porject are made for web, Linux, and an Windows user can participate, avoid duplicate names.

### Recommendations

* Prefer to name in lowercase, to avoid confusion.  
  Use uppercase only when it really make sense.
    > Some systems are case sensitive, some aren't.
    >
    > We waste time deciding how to name each file.
    >
    > Mixed upper and lowercase folders are less eye friendly.

* Strongly prefer to use dash instead of space.

  > Webpages, some compilers and systems have problems to deal with folders with spaces.
  >
  > In webpages, spaces are represented as `%20`, which is not friendly at all. Use dash `-` instead.

### Naming folders:

Firstly, be aware that you can name all folders the any way you want, if that is your concern.

> Obviously some system folders like `.git` can't be even renamed.

## Git commands:

### Add file:

```git
git add doc/lang/pt/readme-4.pt
```

#### add all:

```git
git add .
```

#### Add all files based on part of directory:

```git
git add *readme-4.pt
git add *readme*
```

> Be vigilant for which files have been added.

### Commit:

```git
git commit -m "title" -m "second line"
```
