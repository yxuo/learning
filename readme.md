![](amazing-selfish.gif)

## Goal:

1. To study not very fast, but very constant;
   
   - Update the repository everyday;
   
   - Always post the content at the end of the day, even if it's not completed;
   
   - Over time the content will be updated.

2. Encourage the creation of:
   
   * Code;
   
   * Learning notes;
   
   * Documentation;
   
   * Tutorials.

3. Encourage the consumption, study and exercise of:
   
   * Couses;
   
   * Lessons;
   
   * Tutorials;
   
   * Subjects.

### Purpose of documentation:

1. Learn about the subject;

2. Be readable;

3. Be consultable;

4. Be didactic by the author and interested readers;

5. Solve any doubts that arise, in addiction to what is taught;

6. Have depth no more than the necessary and rasonable;

7. As good practice, to avoid as much as possible to use copyrighted media.
   
   * And quote the source of ressearch.
