## Goal:

1. The main focus is the personal and professional development.

2. The repository content follow the FDS phylosophy: Focused, Clumsy, Simple.

   > In portuguese: **F**ocado, **D**esajeitado, **S**imples.

  * Focused - be functional first, beauty or organization is secondary.

  * Clumsy - even if incomplete of ugly, that is the way.

  * Simple - the minimum of bureaucracy and stupid rules. Be as efficient as possible.

3. Encourage study of any subject, from programming  to drawing. This repository is precisely for this!

4. Encourage creation of:
   
   * Code (files, libraries, projects);
   
   * Exercises;
   
   * Trainings (rewrite the same code from scratch);
   
   * Learning notes;
   
   * Documentation;
   
   * Tutorials (code, article or both).

5. Encourage the consumption, study and exercise of:
   
   * Git e GitHub, by habit.
   
   * Courses;
   
   * Lessons;
   
   * Tutorials;

   * Cases;

## Repository structure

In most of cases it will only have one main branch: `master`.

Whenever this repository needs test subprojects, it will have other branches for testing purposes, as it would be in any project.

The order of files can be changed depending on the circumstances, nothing will be totally plastered and bureaucratic.

## File structure

* :books: Subject (python, c, web, req. analysis, etc)

   * Courses

      * Course author (optional)

        * Course name

           * :book: First language content here

           * Idiom (en, pt)

              * :book: Secondary language content here

   * Cases

      *  Case N

         * Idiom (en, pt)

            * :book: Case readme in other languages

         * :book: Case readme in first language

         * :toolbox: The case content

   * Tutorials

      * Idiom (en, pt)
      
         * :book: Tutorials

         * :toolbox: The content
   
   * Documentation

      * :book: Documentation in one file.

## Naming conventions

* name-always-lowercase

* curse_name-author1-author2

* 1-lesson-name (summarized)

## Rules

* Use Git only via terminal, whenever as possible.

* Main readmes must be updated in all languages at each commit.

* `TODΟs` must be written in uppercase.

* Update the repository everyday. Post commits until the end of the day, don't accumulate ready commits!

### Learning notes

1. Must be written in markdown;

2. Learn about the subject;

3. Be easy to read and teach;

4. Add small doubts only;

5. Distant or in-deep content must be added in the documentation, not here;

6. Have depth no more than the necessary and reasonable;

7. If you want to use explanatory images, tables, etc, do it yourself in markdown, mermaid, in last case, in a image editor.

   * Images used merely as reference can be used.

      * Prefer to add images via link, instead uploading in repository.

8.  Images used merely as reference can be used.

   * It is encouraged the use of screenshots made by you, and upload in repository.

   * Otherwise, prefer to add images via link instead upload a file in repository.

11. Quote the source of research.

### Idiom:

* Preference for content in English.

  * But, if people of your idiom need content, type in your language first. Lately translate to English;

* Commits, tags, comments, etc, in English.

* Content translation to any language is encouraged.

* Translate the content as a way to practice other idioms.

* I know that's boring, but translate the descriptions of images too. ^u^

### Tutorials

* Each translation of tutorial-code must be done from scratch (no ctrl-c), as a way of training.
