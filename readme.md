# Learning repository

![](amazing-selfish.gif)

## Goal:

1. To study not very fast, but very constant;
   
   - Update the repository everyday;
   
   - Always post the content at the end of the day, even if it's not completed;
   
   - Over time the content will be updated.

2. Encourage study of any subject: programming, administration, idiom, drawing, etc. This repository is precisely for this!

3. Encourage creation of:
   
   * Code;
   
   * Exercises;
   
   * Trainings;
   
   * Learning notes;
   
   * Documentation;
   
   * Tutorials.

4. Encourage the consumption, study and exercise of:
   
   * Courses;
   
   * Lessons;
   
   * Tutorials;

   * Cases;

## Repository structure

In most of cases it will only have one main branch: `master`.

Whenever this repository needs test subprojects, it will have other branches for testing purposes, as it would be in any project.

## File structure

* :books: Subject (python, c, web, req. analysis, etc)

   * Courses

      * Course name

         * :book: First language content here

         * Idiom (en, pt)

            * :book: Secondary language content here

   * Cases

      *  Case N

         * Idiom (en, pt)

            * :book: Case readme in other languages

         * :book: Case readme in first language

         * :toolbox: The case content

   * Tutorials

      * Idiom (en, pt)
      
         * :book: Tutoriais

         * :toolbox: The content
   
   * Documentation

      * :book: Documentation in one file.

## Rules

* Main readmes must be updated in all languages at each commit.

### Learning notes

1. Must be written in markdown;

2. Learn about the subject;

3. Be readable;

4. Be consultable;

5. Be didactic;

6. Solve any doubts arisen in that moment;

7. Feel free to add content in addiction to what is taught;

8. Have depth no more than the necessary and rasonable;

9. If you want to use explanatory images, tables, etc, do it yourself in markdown, mermaid, in last case, in a image editor.

   * Images used merely as reference can be used.

      * Prefer to add images via link, instead uploading in repository.

10. Images used merely as reference can be used.

   * It is encouraged the use of screenshots made by you, and upload in repository.

   * Otherwise, prefer to add images via link instead upload a file in repository.

11. Quote the source of ressearch.

### Idiom:

* Preference for content in English.

  * But, if people of your idiom need content, type in your langage first. Lately translate to English;

* Commits, tags, comments, etc, in English.

* Content translation to any language is encouraged.

* Translate the content as a way to practice other idioms.

* I know that's boring, but translate the descriptions of images too. ^u^

### Tutorials

* Each translation of tutorial-code must be done from scratch (no ctrl-c), as a way of training.
