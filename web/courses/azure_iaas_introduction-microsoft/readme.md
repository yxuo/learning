# Azure IaaS introduction - Webinar

Infrastructure as as Service

**Microsoft**

## Goals

* Watch the video and take relevant notes right here;
* If I have to code I put it in the same folder.

## Watch the course:

## Notes

###  Microsoft Cloud services:

* Microsoft 365 - OneDrive, Teams, Outlook. Team collaboration and basic cloud storage.
* Dynamic 365 - Sales, marketing, finance. A portfolio and ecosystem for business guys.
* Azure - infrastructure cloud for create your web apps etc.

### Main focuses of newbies migrating:

* :gear: Remote work models;
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: Cost efficiency &resource constraints;
* :shield: Cybersecutiry;
* :package: "Fragile" on-premisses (locally installed software) operations
* :dart: meeting surge (lots of meeting / week) demand.

Azure is basically a center of database, anything so different from other datacenters.

### Azure core services: 

* :computer: Virtual network - Optional private network (intranet), on premise (local) datacenters, NSG, user defines routes, IP addresses;
* :balance_scale: Load balancer - deliver high availability and performance yo your webapps;
* :door: Firewall - native firewall.

### Creating Azure Vnet

> VNet = Virtual Network


#### Hard way - Using PowerShell Script

> *Not discussed.*

#### Easiest way - Azure site

1. [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com ) 

2. Create a resource > Networking > Virtual Network.  
   Or search `virtual network`.

   * You may find an "app" like this:

        ![azure virtual network](img/azure-vn.png)

3. Fill the textboxes;

   * In "region" field, search in [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies) that makes sense for your needs:

    

   > You can also see the map without an account [here](https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/).

    ![azure server map](img/azure-map.png)

4. IP adresses:

   * When you get a VNet space you must consider your on-pressimes networks, address spaces nwetorks.
   * Config subnets, so you can avoid collisions by overloading your tunnel.

5. Security & Tags:

   * The default settings are just ok so you don't have to config. You can jump to **Review + create**!

6. Review + create:

    > Check the information and finish!

### Storage

        <th>üíΩ Disk Storage</th>
        <th>üìÅ File Storage</th>
        <th>üì¶ Object storage</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:top">

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

* Lift and shift - Rehosting. Make an exact copy of an web app, movint to another server storage.

* Workload (server) - amount of processing that a server will have to deal.

#### :file_folder: File Storage - Azure:

* You can use Azure Files or Azure NetApp Files;

* Azure Brings traditional UNC path storage and shares to your machines in Azure.

* UNC path storage - Universal Naming Convention. A shared folder, on a PC, server.

* You can use a common path between multiple VMs by mouting and sharing paths between VMs.

#### :package: Object storage - Azure Blobs

* Blob - Binary large object.

  * Non structured storage file.

  * A file optimized to storage large amounts of non structured data.

* Blob storage - Your web API stores and retrieves the data inside the blob.

  * You use a blob as a centralized storage location.

  * In Azure (at least) you can access blobs via HTTP requests too.

#### Other storages by Azure

* Azure import/export

* Azure Data Box - simplify and accelerate migrating large amounts of data, in Azure.
